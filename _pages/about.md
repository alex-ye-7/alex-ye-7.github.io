# About Me

Hi! I'm currently a third-year undergraduate at Dartmouth College majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Geography, with a particular 
interest in geographic information systems. I'm also Captain of the Men's Varsity Swimming and Diving teams, a sport in which I have been
involved for over 12 years.
