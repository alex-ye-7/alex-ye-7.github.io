# About Me

Hi! My name is Alex, and I'm a third-year undergraduate at Dartmouth College majoring in computer science and minoring in geography. I'm deeply curious about exploring big questions within healthcare and developing my technical skills to push innovation in technology.

At Dartmouth, I serve as the Captain of the Men's Varsity Swimming and Diving teams. With over 12 years in the sport, it has not only been a passion of mine but also a catalyst for developing strong communication skills in a team-oriented, driven environment. Iâ€™m also involved with the Mental Health Student Union and Dartmouth Tech Consulting groups on campus. 

Thanks for reading and feel free to reach out!
